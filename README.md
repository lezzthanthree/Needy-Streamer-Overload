# Rainmeter Installation
To get the skin, you need to install Rainmeter. Go to this [page](https://www.rainmeter.net/) for installation.

Once done, you can download the `.rmskin` file on the [Releases](https://github.com/lezzthanthree/Needy-Streamer-Overload/releases).

# Features
## Task Manager
Task Manager shows information about your computer performance (Uptime, CPU, RAM, and Disk Space). It is heavily inspired by the Task Manager from the game.  

Values also turn red when reaching the critical zone, so don't overwork your PC!

- Drive on the Disk Space portion can be changed on the `.ini` file.

## Ame
Ame-chan is on your desktop now, and she wants headpats from you!

She will change depending on your computer's performance. She'll be stressed out as you stress your CPU too, so be cautious!

# Warning
It may look cute, but the skin still contains dialogues that depicts self-harm, drugs, and sexual references. Any incidents happen will not be held responsible by the creator of this skin, so make sure you do NOT try any of the more extreme or depressing actions at home.
