Text=got some weird paper that i could hallucinate if i licked it so i did. ten minutes later my vision starts to go a bit wobbly. i felt kinda sluggish and cold but i think thats just my nervous system being a bit stupid... like your room is so warm how are you feeling cold... and then my vision started to get more and wobbly. i had this like five minute song playing but it felt like it was playing for hours and hours... and i could see rainbows in the corner of my vision. i thought wow, so hallucinations really do come in rainbows. just like kangel! i felt so happy. the rainbows started to get bigger and bigger and covered my entire field of vision. i could feel my thoughts get faster and faster. i felt so fluffy and so soft like cotton candy and melted chocolate... it was kinda nice. i think this is all i need. who gives a sh*t about anything anymore these colors are all i need. my entire world started to twist about and my furniture even started to dance around. i started to see faces in the pattern of my rug which was kinda scary but like eh. my aircon started to sound like an entire orchestra tho which was kinda cool. this is so much fun lol. which kinda reminds me i started streaming because i thought itd be fun right? i wanted to live a life free from society and money and stupid adults and thinking about the future or whatever because those things are soooooo booooriiing. so like i said i started streaming coz i thought itd be fun right? but tripping like this is fun too and its so much easier so i should just stick to it lol. oh dang is this what epicureanism is? like why do i have to do so much other stuff when i can have so much fun just by licking a tiny little bit of paper? like explain pls. reality is revolting. i wish this high could last forever. hmmmmm but would p-chan still love me... who even is p-chan and why do i care?
